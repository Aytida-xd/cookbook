# Smallest AI Cookbook

Smallest AI offers an end-to-end Voice AI suite for developers building real-time voice agents. You can use our Speech-to-Text APIs through Pulse STT for high-accuracy transcription, our Text-to-Speech APIs through Lightning TTS for natural-sounding speech synthesis, or use the Atoms Client to build and operate enterprise-ready Voice Agents with features like tool calling, knowledge bases, and campaign management.

This cookbook contains practical examples and tutorials for building with Smallest AI's APIs. Each example is self-contained and demonstrates a real-world use case — from basic transcription to fully autonomous voice agents.

**Documentation:** [Waves (STT & TTS)](https://waves-docs.smallest.ai) · [Atoms (Voice Agents)](https://atoms-docs.smallest.ai/dev) · [Python SDK](https://github.com/smallest-inc/smallest-python-sdk)

---

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
- Python >= 3.10 (install via `uv python install 3.13` if needed)
- A Smallest AI API key — get one at [smallest.ai/console](https://smallest.ai/console)

### Quick Start

Clone the repo, set up a virtual environment, and install the shared dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smallest-inc/cookbook.git
cd cookbook
uv venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up your API key

Each example reads keys from the environment. The easiest way is to copy the `.env.sample` included in every example directory:

```bash
cd speech-to-text/getting-started
cp .env.sample .env
# Add your keys to .env
```

Or export directly in your shell:

```bash
export SMALLEST_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Run an example

```bash
uv run speech-to-text/getting-started/python/transcribe.py recording.wav
```

Some examples need additional dependencies beyond the root `requirements.txt`. Each one has its own `requirements.txt` — install before running:

```bash
uv pip install -r speech-to-text/websocket/jarvis/requirements.txt
uv run speech-to-text/websocket/jarvis/jarvis.py
```

### API Keys

- `SMALLEST_API_KEY` — [smallest.ai/console](https://smallest.ai/console) — Required by all examples
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) — Podcast Summarizer, Meeting Notes, Voice Agents
- `GROQ_API_KEY` — [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) — YouTube Summarizer, Jarvis
- `RECALL_API_KEY` — [recall.ai](https://recall.ai) — Meeting Notes

## Speech-to-Text Examples

Convert audio and video to text with industry-leading accuracy. Supports 30+ languages with features like speaker diarization, word timestamps, and emotion detection. Powered by [Pulse STT](https://waves-docs.smallest.ai/v4.0.0/content/speech-to-text-new/overview).

- [Getting Started](./speech-to-text/getting-started/) — Basic transcription, the simplest way to start
- [Jarvis Voice Assistant](./speech-to-text/websocket/jarvis/) — Always-on assistant with wake word detection, LLM reasoning, and TTS
- [Online Meeting Notetaker](./speech-to-text/online-meeting-notetaking-bot/) — Join Google Meet / Zoom / Teams via Recall.ai, auto-identify speakers by name, generate structured notes
- [Podcast Summarizer](./speech-to-text/podcast-summarizer/) — Transcribe and summarize podcasts with key takeaways using GPT
- [YouTube Summarizer](./speech-to-text/youtube-summarizer/) — Extract audio from YouTube videos and generate concise summaries

## Voice Agents Examples

Build AI voice agents that can talk to anyone on voice or text, in any language, in any voice. The Atoms SDK provides abstractions like KnowledgeBase, Campaigns, and graph-based Workflows to let you build the smartest voice agent for your use case. Powered by the [Atoms SDK](https://atoms-docs.smallest.ai/dev).

- [Getting Started](./voice-agents/getting_started/) — Create your first agent with `OutputAgentNode`, `generate_response()`, and `AtomsApp`
- [Agent with Tools](./voice-agents/agent_with_tools/) — Add tool calling with `@function_tool` and `ToolRegistry`
- [Knowledge Base RAG](./voice-agents/knowledge_base_rag/) — Attach a knowledge base with PDF upload and URL scraping for grounded responses
- [Campaigns](./voice-agents/campaigns/) — Provision bulk outbound calling with audiences and campaign management
- [Language Switching](./voice-agents/language_switching/) — Multi-node agents with dynamic language detection and switching

**[See all Voice Agents examples &rarr;](./voice-agents/)**

## Language Support

Each example includes implementations in:

- **Python** — Uses `requests`, `websockets`, and standard libraries
- **JavaScript** — Uses `node-fetch`, `ws`, and Node.js built-ins

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines. In short:

1. Create a folder with a descriptive name
2. Add implementations in `python/` and/or `javascript/` subdirectories
3. Include a `README.md` and `.env.sample`
4. If the example needs deps beyond the root `requirements.txt`, add a local `requirements.txt`
5. Update this root README with your new example
