# Call Control

Comprehensive call control: end calls, cold transfers, and warm transfers.

## Features

- **SDKAgentEndCallEvent** — End calls gracefully
- **Cold Transfer** — Immediate handoff to another agent
- **Warm Transfer** — Brief the receiving agent before handoff
- **Hold Music Options** — Different music styles while transferring

## Demo

**End Call**:
```
User: That's all I needed, goodbye!
Assistant: Great, glad I could help! Take care!
[Call ends]
```

**Cold Transfer**:
```
User: I need to speak to a real person
Assistant: I'll connect you to a human agent now. Please hold.
[User hears relaxing music, then connects to +1234567890]
```

**Warm Transfer**:
```
User: I need to speak to a supervisor about my billing issue
Assistant: I'll brief my supervisor and connect you right away.
[Supervisor receives: "Customer escalation: billing issue"]
[User hears uplifting music, then connects to supervisor]
```

## Requirements

> Base dependencies are installed via the root `requirements.txt`. See the [main README](../../README.md#usage) for setup. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env`.

Configure transfer numbers in `app.py`:
```python
agent = SupportAgent(
    cold_transfer_number="+1234567890",   # General support
    warm_transfer_number="+1987654321"    # Supervisor
)
```

## Usage

Start the server:

```bash
uv run app.py
```

Connect with the CLI:

```bash
smallestai agent chat
```

## Recommended Usage

- Agents that need to end calls gracefully or transfer callers to human agents
- Cold and warm transfer patterns for support escalation
- For IVR-style department routing, [Inbound IVR](../inbound_ivr/) is recommended

## Key Snippets

### End Call

```python
from smallestai.atoms.agent.events import SDKAgentEndCallEvent

@function_tool()
async def end_call(self) -> None:
    """End the call gracefully."""
    await self.send_event(SDKAgentEndCallEvent())
```

### Cold Transfer (Immediate)

```python
from smallestai.atoms.agent.events import (
    SDKAgentTransferConversationEvent,
    TransferOption,
    TransferOptionType,
)

@function_tool()
async def cold_transfer(self) -> None:
    """Immediate transfer to human agent."""
    await self.send_event(
        SDKAgentTransferConversationEvent(
            transfer_call_number="+1234567890",
            transfer_options=TransferOption(
                type=TransferOptionType.COLD_TRANSFER
            ),
            on_hold_music="relaxing_sound"
        )
    )
```

### Warm Transfer (With Briefing)

```python
@function_tool()
async def warm_transfer(self, reason: str) -> None:
    """Brief supervisor first, then transfer."""
    await self.send_event(
        SDKAgentTransferConversationEvent(
            transfer_call_number="+1987654321",
            transfer_options=TransferOption(
                type=TransferOptionType.WARM_TRANSFER,
                private_handoff_option={
                    "type": "prompt",
                    "prompt": f"Customer escalation: {reason}"
                }
            ),
            on_hold_music="uplifting_beats"
        )
    )
```
